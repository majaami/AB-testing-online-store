# AB-testing-online-store

In this project we were going to to help a big online store to:  Prioritize hypotheses based on their ICE and RICE score; Analyze results of an A/B testing.

1. Prioritizing hypotheses based on ICE score:

2. Prioritizing hypotheses base on RICE score:

Comparing ICE and RICE score

Based on the relative positions according to both ICE and RICE scores, hypotheses 7,0,2 and 6 would be the strongest candidates for testing.

3. After the analysis of cumulative revenue, average order sizes an relative differences between them, as well as finding whether the differences between the groups are statistically significant, we can conclude that:

The Conversion rate of group B is greater than that of the group A.

There is no significant difference between average order sizes between the two groups.

We can therefore state, that the A/B testing proved that the hypothesis tested will improve the conversion rate, however, it will not affect the average purchase size.

The possible decisions are:

Stop the test, consider one of the groups the leader.
Stop the test, conclude that there is no difference between the groups.
Continue the test.
From our conclusions, we can say that a) there is no reason to continue testing as the results were clear and reflected stable tendencies. b) Although there was no significant difference between order size between both groups, It was clearly shown that there is a difference in the conversion rates between the two groups.

We therefore conclude that:

The test can be stopped,
Group B appeared as a leader and signficantly increased conversion rates.
